                    <p>I had been working as full stack developer for over 5 years.</p>
                    <p>I strive to build immersive and beautiful web applications through the carefully crafted code and
                        user-centric design.</p>
                    <p>For me, the most attractive aspect of technology is problem solving. Problem solving is a
                        challenge I have always loved â€“ from completing puzzles at home through to programming at
                        university. </p>
